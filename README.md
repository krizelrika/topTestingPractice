# 🧪 JavaScript Testing Practice (Jest)

This project is part of The Odin Project’s JavaScript curriculum, focused on learning how to write and run automated tests using Jest and ES6 modules.

The goal of this assignment is to practice Test-Driven Development (TDD) by writing tests first, then implementing functions until all tests pass.

## 📌 Project Objectives
- Learn how to set up Jest with ES6 import/export
- Write unit tests for small, pure JavaScript functions
- Implement functions that satisfy the test cases
- Understand how testing improves confidence and code quality

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- JavaScript (ES6)
- Jest – JavaScript testing framework
- Babel – Enables ES6 module support in Jest
